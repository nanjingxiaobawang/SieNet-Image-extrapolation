# Abstract
In this paper, we propose a novel two-stage siamese adversarial model for image extrapolation, named Siamese Expansion Network(SiENet). In two stages, a novel border sensitive convolution named filling convolution is designed for allowing encoder to predict the unknown content, alleviating the burden of decoder. Besides, to introduce prior knowledge to network and reinforce the inferring ability of encoder, siamese adversarial mechanism is designed to enable our network to model covered long range feature toward the uncovered image feature.

# Run 
our method is evaluated on three datasets, i.e., Cityscapes, paris street-view and beach . Single-direction evaluation is made on Scenery dataset. Smooth image
could be get by [structureflow](https://github.com/RenYurui/StructureFlow)

You can download these datasets from their project website.

1.[CelebA](http://mmlab.ie.cuhk.edu.hk/projects/CelebA.html)

2.[Paris Street-View](https://github.com/pathak22/context-encoder)

3.[beach](https://github.com/bendangnuksung/Image-OutPainting)

4.[scenery](https://github.com/z-x-yang/NS-Outpainting)

# Mask dataset
You need to generate mask, We give a mask for your reference.

# Train

To train our model, modify the model config file model_config.yaml. You may need to change the path of dataset or the parameters of the networks etc. Then run the following code:

```
python train.py  --name=[the name of your experiment] --path=[path save the results]
```

# Testing
## Pretrained model 
you can achieve pretrained model here:
[Paris]()
[Cityscapes]()
 you can use the test.py to generate results. Run the following code:

```
python test.py --name=[the name of your experiment] --path=[path of your experiments] --input=[input images] --mask=[mask images] --structure=[structure images] --output=[path to save the output images] --model=[which model to be tested]
```
